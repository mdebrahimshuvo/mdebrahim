A person holding a hand axe

Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error.[11] Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble, forming a sharp hand axe.[12] This practice was refined 75 kya (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer work.[13]

The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as "possibly the greatest ever made by man".[14] Archaeological, dietary, and social evidence point to "continuous [human] fire-use" at least 1.5 Mya.
